[GitBub.2013-TIP-NADD] is a method to generate a binary (halftone) pattern from a grayscale image with the NADD dot diffusion (DD) halftoning technique.

All the technical details of this method are published in this following article:
Yun-Fu Liu and Jing-Ming Guo, "New class tiling design for dot-diffused halftoning," IEEE Trans. Image Processing, vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 1199-1208, March 2013.

[GitBub.2013-TIP-NADD] is implemented in C++ with OpenCV v2.4.7.

How to run:
	If you are using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 as your IDE, then you can simply run prog.sln with all the completed settings for corresponding results. 
	Otherwise, the source code "sample code.cpp" and both "lib/nadd.cpp" and "lib/nadd.h" are provided for various platforms.
